									“For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord”.
								<br /> <br>
								They say time heals, but neither time nor reason can change how I feel. The days we once shared are gone, yet in my heart, you will always be with me. The gates of memory will never shut.<br>
								Your passing was so sudden and unexpected, a great shock to me. Mr. Ofori came to deliver the news on that fateful afternoon of November 17, 2024, just as I was preparing to visit you at The Bank Hospital, where you were receiving care, because Samuel couldn’t bring himself to tell me.
								<br>It was my greatest desire that we would grow old together when we married 30 years ago, but you didn’t wait for any of our children to marry, and that deeply saddens me.
								<br>You were a good man, disciplined, principled, and a devoted Christian. Thank you for the love you gave me, for always standing in the gap and praying for our family. Thank you for teaching me strength in the Lord. 
								I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with you and then I realised you spent the rest of your life with me. Those special memories of you will always bring a smile to my face.
								<br /> <br>
								Though your absence will forever cause me pain, you will remain in my heart until we meet again.

								<p>My heart breaks for my son, Owuraku Daniel.<br />
									Your passing came as such a shock because you always promised to visit. It has been so long since I saw you in person. From time to time, you would call, but had always loved to see you face-to-face.
								 <br />
									Now, you are gone, but I hold on to hope. <br> <br />
								 <b>“In the sweet by and by, we shall meet again on that beautiful shore.”

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/dad.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p id="father-p">The love you showed us can be likened to that of a lioness and her cubs. You loved us so deeply and were protective to a fault. Your incessant calls and texts are all we now yearn for. We'd give anything to hear one of your dry jokes again, to see you sitting in your favourite chair enjoying a good home-cooked meal. All these are now fond memories we'd definitely cherish forever. 
									<br /> <br>
									To say we never saw this coming is an understatement. Da, our hearts are broken. Why should your life have to end when ours have only just begun? We hope you know we'd have given anything just to keep you here with us longer, but God has the final say. 
									<br>We take comfort in the fact that you departed peacefully, which is very befitting because you were a man of peace. We take solace in the belief that you are now with your Creator, whom you loved and worshipped diligently here on earth, and that's our only source of joy currently. You'll know no more sickness or pain. We miss you dearly Da, but we have no doubt that you're in a far better place. Of all the challenges we've faced together as a family, this is by far the biggest, but it is well.
									<br /> <br>
									You were a strong and prayerful soldier, and you raised us in the same manner. You saw us all through good schools successfully, not because you were rich, but because you were passionate about us receiving quality education. Till you took your last breath, you were a present father, not just physically but emotionally and spiritually. We are eternally grateful. You always expressed how proud you were of us, and we promise to make you even prouder.
								    <br>Today, we your princes and princesses bid you farewell. We love you Da! Your love, wisdom, and memories will remain forever etched in our hearts. 
									<br>May your soul rest in perfect peace, till we meet again.

									<b>Jeremiah 31:3
										“The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”
									</b>
									<br /> <br>
									Dear brother, this was your favourite Bible verse when you were converted to Christianity in the late 1980s. You cherished it so much that you pasted it on red heart stickers and placed them on your room divider. Truly, God drew you to Himself with His everlasting love.
									<br>You invited me to join you in your new home at Sakumono because you were still single at the time. You were a man of prayer who loved the Lord deeply and always sought to serve Him. Your love for people was evident in your efforts to help anyone in need.
									<br>When I got married and my husband was living abroad, I returned to live with you since you were still single. My children were born in your home, and we lived together as one family. Even after you got married and I moved out, our bond remained strong. You took care of my children whenever I was away. That was the kind of brother you were a pillar of support and love.
									<br>You went through many transitions in life, yet our connection never wavered. Whenever I came home, I always sought you out.
									<br> <br />
									When I learned of your illness and hospitalization on the 5th of November, I earnestly prayed for God to spare your life. Each update I received gave me hope, as I was told you were improving. But on that fateful Sunday, the 17th of November, I received the heart-wrenching news of your passing. What a shock it was!
									<br>Yet, in my sorrow, I find comfort in knowing you belonged to the Lord, and He knows what is best. We will continue to praise Him, holding on to your favourite song:
									<br /> <br>
									<b>"I will praise You, Lord, with every breath that I take.
									I will praise You, Lord, this promise I make.
									When eternity ends and starts over again,
									Even then, I will praise You, Lord."
									God be with you till we meet again. Rest in His perfect peace.</b>

										Our son, brother, and uncle Owura,
										It is with heavy hearts that we bid you farewell.
										<br /> <br>
										Though we did not see you often in person, you always stayed connected with us, especially through WhatsApp. Your messages of encouragement, inspiration, and timely alerts have been a source of strength and guidance.
										<br />
										 You had a heart full of love and a desire to help others whenever you had the means. We wished to see you more in person, as some family members never had the chance to meet you face-to-face. Despite this, our love for you remains unwavering, and your absence will be deeply felt.
										<br>
										Our greatest comfort lies in knowing that you gave your life to the Lord. You were steadfast in your faith, prayerful and devoted to your relationship with God. These assure us that we will meet again in His presence one day.
										<br> <br />
										Rest peacefully in the loving arms of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. <br>
										<b>Mo wosi saminya, Bro Owura.</b>
