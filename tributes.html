									“For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord”.
								<br /> <br>
								They say time heals, but neither time nor reason can change how I feel. The days we once shared are gone, yet in my heart, you will always be with me. The gates of memory will never shut.<br>
								Your passing was so sudden and unexpected, a great shock to me. Mr. Ofori came to deliver the news on that fateful afternoon of November 17, 2024, just as I was preparing to visit you at The Bank Hospital, where you were receiving care, because Samuel couldn’t bring himself to tell me.
								<br>It was my greatest desire that we would grow old together when we married 30 years ago, but you didn’t wait for any of our children to marry, and that deeply saddens me.
								<br>You were a good man, disciplined, principled, and a devoted Christian. Thank you for the love you gave me, for always standing in the gap and praying for our family. Thank you for teaching me strength in the Lord. 
								I was supposed to spend the rest of my life with you and then I realised you spent the rest of your life with me. Those special memories of you will always bring a smile to my face.
								<br /> <br>
								Though your absence will forever cause me pain, you will remain in my heart until we meet again.

									Your passing came as such a shock because you always promised to visit. It has been so long since I saw you in person. From time to time, you would call, but had always loved to see you face-to-face.
								 <br />
									Now, you are gone, but I hold on to hope. <br> <br />
								 <b>“In the sweet by and by, we shall meet again on that beautiful shore.”
									 Rest well, my son.</b>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p id="father-p">It is with a heavy heart that we pay this solemn tribute to you our dearest and beloved father. There are no words to describe how we felt when the news of your sudden demise came to our realisation. It’s such an indescribable feeling, one that no can truly understand. 
									<br /> <br>
									To say that we miss you would be an understatement. To say that we wish you were here so that we can continue to enjoy your unique presence would be putting a restraint on the heavy sense of loss we feel. 
									<br>Daddy! You instilled Godly morals and values in us which guided us and prevented us from straying. You were so prayerful and did not leave your family out. You always led us in family devotions and ensured we developed personal relationships with God. You would encourage us to share our views on scriptures we read in the bible. You always counselled us, spoke daily blessings over our lives, disciplined us, provided for us even when things were not so smooth. You did your best for us daddy and you were a great father and for this, we are forever grateful.
									<br /> <br>
									It's heart-breaking to know that we will no longer see your sweet face, your smile, feel your peaceful presence, hear you tell us how precious we are to you and how much you love us, receive long yet beautiful text messages, and a whole lot more that cannot be penned.
								    <br>Today, your princes and princesses bid you fare well. We strongly believe that you are in a better place, in the bosom of the Lord.
                                    <br>We love you forever and your memories will forever be cherished. 
									<br>May your soul rest in perfect peace daddy!

									<b>Jeremiah 31:3
										“The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”
									</b>
									<br /> <br>
									Dear brother, this was your favourite Bible verse when you were converted to Christianity in the late 1980s. You cherished it so much that you pasted it on red heart stickers and placed them on your room divider. Truly, God drew you to Himself with His everlasting love.
									<br>You invited me to join you in your new home at Sakumono because you were still single at the time. You were a man of prayer who loved the Lord deeply and always sought to serve Him. Your love for people was evident in your efforts to help anyone in need.
									<br>When I got married and my husband was living abroad, I returned to live with you since you were still single. My children were born in your home, and we lived together as one family. Even after you got married and I moved out, our bond remained strong. You took care of my children whenever I was away. That was the kind of brother you were a pillar of support and love.
									<br>You went through many transitions in life, yet our connection never wavered. Whenever I came home, I always sought you out.
									<br> <br />
									When I learned of your illness and hospitalization on the 5th of November, I earnestly prayed for God to spare your life. Each update I received gave me hope, as I was told you were improving. But on that fateful Sunday, the 17th of November, I received the heart-wrenching news of your passing. What a shock it was!
									<br>Yet, in my sorrow, I find comfort in knowing you belonged to the Lord, and He knows what is best. We will continue to praise Him, holding on to your favourite song:
									<br /> <br>
									<b>"I will praise You, Lord, with every breath that I take.
									I will praise You, Lord, this promise I make.
									When eternity ends and starts over again,
									Even then, I will praise You, Lord."
									God be with you till we meet again. Rest in His perfect peace.</b>

										Our son, brother, and uncle Owura,
										It is with heavy hearts that we bid you farewell.
										<br /> <br>
										Though we did not see you often in person, you always stayed connected with us, especially through WhatsApp. Your messages of encouragement, inspiration, and timely alerts have been a source of strength and guidance.
										<br />
										 You had a heart full of love and a desire to help others whenever you had the means. We wished to see you more in person, as some family members never had the chance to meet you face-to-face. Despite this, our love for you remains unwavering, and your absence will be deeply felt.
										<br>
										Our greatest comfort lies in knowing that you gave your life to the Lord. You were steadfast in your faith, prayerful and devoted to your relationship with God. These assure us that we will meet again in His presence one day.
										<br> <br />
										Rest peacefully in the loving arms of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. <br>
										<b>Mo wosi saminya, Bro Owura.</b>
