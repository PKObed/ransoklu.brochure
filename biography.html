									<h1>THE LATE<br />
									RANSFORD DANIEL OKLU</h1>
									<p id="BIO">Ransford Daniel Oklu, affectionately known as Owuraku by his family, was born on April 5, 1955, in Agbedeafo, a small village in Ada. 
										He was the son of the late Mr. Edward Narh Oklu and Madam Dora Anim. Raised by his grandfather in Agbedeafo, 
										Ransford began his education at Agbedeafo Presbyterian Primary School and later continued at Sege L.A. Middle School in Sege, Ada.
										<br /> <br>
										In 1972, after completing middle school, Ransford moved to Kokomlemle, Accra, to live with his aunt, Madam Francisca Promise Attie Einhorn, and her husband. Driven by a passion for education and professional development, he pursued studies with The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 1973, earning certificates in English, Structure of Commerce, Arithmetic, and Bookkeeping with Distinction. He further enhanced his knowledge by obtaining certificates in Accounting, Economics, Arithmetic, and Office Practice through The Royal Society of Arts Examinations Board in 1974. 
										<br />Ransford began his professional career in 1976 as a bank clerk at Barclays Bank Ghana in Takoradi. His dedication to continuous improvement and learning saw him rise through the ranks, ultimately attaining senior positions in the bank. As an internal auditor and financial administrator, he travelled extensively across Ghana, working in cities such as Sunyani, Kumasi, Cape Coast, and Tamale. In the late 1980s, he was transferred to the Barclays Bank Head Office in Accra, where he settled at Sakumono Estates and established firm roots. 
										In 1991, Ransford attended the Bank of Ghana Training School, successfully completing the “Inspection & Audit Procedures Programme.” <br /> Continuing his pursuit of professional excellence, he obtained a certificate in Intermediate Management Development from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA) in 1996. That same year, he earned a certificate in Treasury Management from the National Banking College, Ghana. 
										In 1994, Ransford married his beloved wife, Gloria Nana Esi Obbin. Together, they built a close-knit and loving family, blessed with four children. After retiring from Barclays Bank, Ransford ventured into entrepreneurship, establishing himself as a successful merchant and business consultant. 
										<br /> <br>
										A devout Christian with unwavering faith and strong moral values, Ransford became the administrator of Maranatha Power Ministries International in 2009, where he served faithfully and diligently. In 2012, he and his family joined Lighthouse Chapel International, Morning Star Cathedral, continuing their commitment to God’s work. Ransford was known for his wisdom, humility, and kindness, qualities he imparted to his family and all those who knew him. He remained devoted to his family and faith, living a life of purpose and fulfilment. 
										After a brief illness, Ransford passed away peacefully on November 17, 2024. His legacy of love, dedication, and faith will forever remain in the hearts of his family and the many lives he touched. “The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death” (Isaiah 57:1-2 NIV).
