								<p>
								Begone, unbelief,<br>
								My Savior is near,<br>
								And for my relief<br>
								Will surely appear;<br>
								By prayer let me wrestle,<br>
								And He will perform;<br>
								With Christ in the vessel,<br>
								I smile at the storm.<br>					
								<br /> <br>
								Though dark be my way,<br>
								Since He is my Guide,<br>
								’Tis mine to obey,<br>
								’Tis His to provide;<br>
								Though cisterns be broken,<br>
								And creatures all fail,<br>
								The word He hath spoken<br>
								Shall surely prevail.<br>
								<br /> <br>
								His love, in time past,<br>
								Forbids me to think<br>
								He’ll leave me at last<br>
								In trouble to sink:<br>
								Each sweet Ebenezer<br>
								I have in review<br>
								Confirms His good pleasure<br>
								To help me quite through.<br>
                                <br /> <br>
								Why should I complain<br>
								Of want or distress,<br>
								Temptation or pain?<br>
								He told me no less;<br>
								The heirs of salvation,<br>
								I know from His Word,<br>
								Through much tribulation<br>
								Must follow their Lord.<br>
								<br /> <br>
								How bitter that cup<br>
								No heart can conceive,<br>
								Which He drank quite up,<br>
								That sinners might live!<br>
								His way was much rougher<br>
								And darker than mine;<br>
								Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,<br>
								And shall I repine?<br>
                                <br /> <br>
								Since all that I meet<br>
								Shall work for my good,<br>
								The bitter is sweet,<br>
								The medicine, food;<br>
								Though painful at present,<br>
								’Twill cease before long,<br>
								And then, oh, how pleasant<br>
								The conqueror’s song!<br>
